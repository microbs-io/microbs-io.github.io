## [](what-is-microbs)What is microbs?

microbs is an open source, vendor-inclusive framework to demo, test, or learn about microservices observability.

With little [configuration](/docs/usage/configuration) and one [command](/docs/usage/cli), you can deploy a tech stack with your choice of:

* **Sample apps** (e.g. [ecommerce](/docs/apps/ecommerce), [templates](/docs/apps/templates))
* **Simulated issues** (e.g. bugs, traffic spikes)
* **Synthetics** (e.g. realistic user traffic generation)
* **Kubernetes platforms** (e.g. [GKE](/docs/plugins/kubernetes/gke), [minikube](/docs/plugins/kubernetes/minikube), [kind](/docs/plugins/kubernetes/kind))
* **Observability stacks** (e.g. [Grafana](/docs/plugins/observability/grafana-cloud), [Elastic](/docs/plugins/observability/elastic-cloud))

You can make your own [apps](/docs/apps) or [plugins](/docs/plugins) for a more customized experience. More plugins are planned for the future.

|? microbs is a project of the open source community. microbs is not officially supported by any vendors named in this documentation or the software (e.g. Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Elastic, Grafana), though employees or partners of those vendors may contribute to the project.
