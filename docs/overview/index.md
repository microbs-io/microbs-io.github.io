## [](what-is-microbs)What is microbs?

microbs is an open source, vendor-inclusive framework to demo, test, or learn about microservices observability.

With little configuration and one command, you can automatically deploy a tech stack with your choice of any combination of the following...

* **Sample applications** (e.g. [ecommerce](/docs/apps/ecommerce), [templates](/docs/apps/templates),  or make your own)
* **Simulated issues** (e.g. bugs, traffic spikes, or make your own)
* **Synthetics** (e.g. real-time synthetic user interactions)
* **Kubernetes platforms** (e.g. [minikube](/docs/plugins/kubernetes/minikube), [GKE](/docs/plugins/kubernetes/gke))
* **Observability solutions** (e.g. [Elastic Cloud](/docs/plugins/observability/elastic_cloud), [Grafana Cloud](/docs/plugins/observability/grafana_cloud))

microbs creates immersive experiences that are ideal for several use cases:

* **Demo** - Create interactive stories with your tech stacks.
